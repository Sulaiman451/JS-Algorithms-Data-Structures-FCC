# The Task

We have a function named rangeOfNumbers with parameters startNum and endNum. It should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by startNum and ends with a number represented by endNum.

The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number. The function must use recursion by calling iteself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where startNum and endNum are of the same value.

Refer to recursionRange.js to see my solution, comments, and at the end of the file the original problem.
