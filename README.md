## The Task

A function called countdown has been defined with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter.

If the function is called with a number less than 1, it should return an empty array. The function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind. Refer to recursionCountdown.js to see my solution, comments, and at the end of the file the original problem.
